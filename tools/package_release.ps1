MegaManX5Recomp $Version

Mega Man X5 boots from the PlayStation BIOS and plays - through the opening
(including the intro cutscenes, which now decode and play), into stages, with
working controller input and memory-card save/load, and no known crashes. It has
not yet been verified all the way to the end, so treat this first release as a
very playable preview rather than a certified full playthrough.

This package does not include the Mega Man X5 disc, the PlayStation BIOS, save
data, or any game assets - you supply those from your own collection, and
MegaManX5Recomp asks for them one at a time (each dialog says which one it
wants). The executable and the cache folder contain statically recompiled
(machine-translated) builds of the game's code, the same distribution model
used by other static recompilation projects such as N64: Recompiled.

First launch:
1. Run MegaManX5Recomp.exe. A launcher window opens.
2. In the launcher, set your PlayStation BIOS: select your legally obtained
   SCPH1001.BIN (a 512 KB file dumped from your own console).
3. Set the game disc: select your legally obtained Mega Man X5 (USA,
   SLUS-01334) disc image.
4. Adjust any options you like (renderer, supersampling, screen look,
   controller), then press Launch. Your choices are remembered next time.

Disc image formats:
- .cue + .bin (preferred - pick the .cue)
- .bin
Do NOT convert to a 2048-byte "cooked" .iso - it discards the XA sectors MMX5
streams its FMV/audio from.

The selected BIOS path is saved in bios.cfg and the selected disc path is saved
in disc.cfg next to the executable. Delete those files to pick different files.

Options such as turbo loads, FMV skip, and disc speed can be changed in the
launcher Settings or in game.toml ([runtime]/[video]) with any text editor.

The cache folder contains pre-converted native code for game areas covered so
far; those run at full speed from your first visit. As you play, newly visited
areas are recorded into overlay_captures.json and your local cache grows
automatically. Do NOT post overlay_captures.json publicly - it contains
snapshots of the game's own code read from your disc. See README.md for details.

Keyboard and Xbox-style controller defaults are documented in README.md.
Controller mappings are configurable in input.ini.

Memory cards are stored in the saves directory; save and load work with standard
PS1 .mcd images.
